	  <tr>
	 	    <td colspan="4"><h1>Belgian Malinois</h1></td>
	 	          <td><img src="BM.jpg" width="230" height=180></td>
<td cellspan="8" width="400" style="text-align: center;">Belgian Malinois originated in Belgium is one of its kind, their loyalty to their masters is matchless. Their intelligence, agility, energy, stealth, and loyalty are the things that made them be recognized by the people especially in K9. They can be police dogs or even dogs to be sent out to battlefields as if they could keep up with their companions. These type of dogs are very clever, you can't trick them twice in a row using the same technique because they could cope up and understanding things just in a short period of time.</td>

	 	    <td colspan="4"><h1>Saint Bernard</h1></td>
	 	          <td><img src="St.B.jpg" width="230" height=180></td>
<td cellspan="8" width="400" style="text-align: center;">Saint Bernard are overwhelmingly large dog breeds who are known as the farmer's pet. What I'm really fond of this dog is its Intelligence, mellow, playful behavior, and learn how they can serve and a family like you have. They could be also an indoor pet as if they're "Gentle Giants", they're so sweet, loving, and caring pet who's ready for ACTION 24/7. Though they are not as quick and atheltic as the Belgian but nevertheless they are more refined and calmed which really does suits each of our family. </td>

  <tr>
	 	    <td colspan="4"><h1>Dobermann</h1></td>
	 	          <td><img src="DBM.jpg" width="230" height=180></td>
<td cellspan="8" width="400" style="text-align: center;">Doberman is a true man's best friend as it really shows what is a real "MAN" made of. They are sleek and so sneaky the fact that you won't recognized they're just behind you watching whatever you're planning to do. In terms of their behavior they're quite sensitive, they are trained to be sky high loyal to their masters whereas at some point they would never ever betray their masters even ONCE. They are really suitable as a guard dog due to their dominating presence, I mean look at them, do you think there's still someone who is brave enough to do something foolish right in front of them? I don't think you would be able to survive as their Athletism is on a WHOLE different level. </td>

	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 	    <td colspan="4"><h1>Yorkie</h1></td>
	 	          <td><img src="YORKIE.jpg" width="230" height=180></td>
<td cellspan="8" width="400" style="text-align: center;">Yorkie is the most different looking type of breed here on my list. I have a yorkie and that's says it all why I would include it here in my list. Yorkie is a small dog breed that originates from Yorkshire,England. Despite their diminutive size, Yorkies are very protective, curious, courageous, and they really are different when they are angry. Even though they're small we shouldn't undertestimate them because they don't want getting bothered so much to the fact that they would show their teeth which is clearly a BAD sign.</td>
